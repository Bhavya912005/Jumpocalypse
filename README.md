# Jumpocalpyse
## A SuperMario inspired game made with Unity
Welcome to Jumpocalypse, an exhilarating 3D gaming experience crafted in Unity, where players guide the main character through a series of challenges. The character possesses the ability to run and navigate through various obstacles. Upon collecting the red mushroom, the character undergoes a size-altering transformation. Navigating through a green pipe, the character descends into underground, gathering coins before emerging triumphantly through the same pipe. Amidst the journey, encounters with a poisonous mushroom pose risks and rewards. Vanquishing it grants an extra life, while a touch diminishes the character's size. Facing diverse obstacles, the character progresses to a castle door, signaling entry into the second world. In this new landscape, the character encounters a beneficial green mushroom, increasing their life count. Traversing moving wedges and diverse buildings, the player confronts challenges, including navigating through rotating fireballs. The ultimate goal awaits at a colossal mushroom, accompanied by the triumphant 'YOU WIN' text. Jumpocalypse offers a concise yet thrilling gaming experience, blending strategic mushroom interactions, diverse landscapes, and exhilarating obstacles for players to overcome. To enhance the overall gaming experience, a user-friendly main menu is provided, offering players the choice to either quit the game or restart the game if they have lost all three lives.
